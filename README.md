# Code of Conduct

In order to foster an inclusive, kind, harassment-free, and cooperative community, AGENCY04 enforces this code of conduct - related to any and all aspects of AGENCY04 life.

## Summary
Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is completely unacceptable anywhere in AGENCY04 project codebases, issue trackers, chat-rooms, mailing lists, meetups, other events and every day conversations between ourselves and/or our customers and partners. Violators will be warned by any AGENCY04 member. Repeat violations will result in a one-on-one talk with the CEO at or before the 3rd violation.

## In detail
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from communication systems, and escalation to management.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a senior AGENCY04 member immediately.

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in AGENCY04 project codebases, issue trackers, chat-rooms, and mailing lists and of course live conversations .

Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.
